#  INTERACTIVE-QUIZ-APPLICATION
Internship Project by Kare Manasa| frontend developement at codetech IT solutions

**COMPANY**: CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS  
**NAME**: KARE MANASA  
**INTERN ID**: CT04DH1654  
**DOMAIN**: FRONT END DEVELOPMENT  
**DURATION**: 4 WEEKS  
**MENTOR**: NEELA SANTOSH  


This project is an **Interactive Quiz Application** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is designed as part of the CodTech internship program to demonstrate dynamic front-end capabilities, interactivity, and logic building in JavaScript. The quiz application allows users to test their knowledge by answering multiple-choice questions. 

Upon launching the application, users are presented with a question and several answer options. Once the user selects an answer, the application provides **immediate feedback** by highlighting the correct and incorrect options using color cues. A **scoring system** is implemented that updates the user's score based on their answer accuracy. The next button allows users to move forward until all 10 questions are completed, and a final score summary is shown at the end.

The UI is designed to be clean, responsive, and user-friendly. CSS is used for layout, spacing, color theming, and transitions, creating a pleasant and professional quiz experience. JavaScript handles all quiz logic, such as loading questions dynamically from an array, checking answers, updating scores, and progressing through the quiz.

This project showcases proficiency in:
- DOM Manipulation
- Event Handling
- State Management in JS
- UI Feedback and Response
- Basic animations and responsive styling

It can be extended further to include features such as:
- A countdown timer for each question
- Storing and displaying high scores using localStorage
- Adding question categories or difficulty levels
- Fetching questions from a JSON file or API

This task helped me strengthen my understanding of how JavaScript interacts with the DOM and how to create logic for real-world web interfaces. I also gained insight into writing clean, structured code that’s easy to debug and scale.

Overall, this interactive quiz application successfully meets all the internship requirements, offering dynamic question loading, scoring, and feedback — all packed into a responsive interface that can be run in any modern browser.
